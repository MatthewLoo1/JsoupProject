Target User: Kriss | Keyword: love | Their Review: I love these bowls, sometimes more than my ceramic ones. They don’t get too hot in the microwave, even when heating up soup, and they’re a great size. Plus you can’t beat the price.
Target User: Michiganmom | Keyword: love | Their Review: Love the size and height. Perfect mix between a plate and bowl . Easy to clean and great quality
Target User: April F | Keyword: love | Their Review: I love these light weight dishes. I mean first off the pink is so cute, especially if you have a pink starbies or Stanley to pair it with. Can’t wait to use this set for my lunch.
Target User: Nico | Keyword: Can | Their Review: This bowl is great for the price. It's pretty durable and can be microwaved.
Target User: Honesty | Keyword: Can | Their Review: This bowl is easy to clean and is durable. I like how I can make a big bowl of cereal or a meal. The only thing I dislike is that it can spill easily. The bowl is thinner than others, so it can feel flimsy. I haven’t had any trouble with putting hot ramen in it but I hold it from the top and not the bottom.

Target User: Nia757 | Keyword: Scratch | Their Review: These are great but for some reason the scratch worse than the plates. But they are cheap so I dont expect much. They get the job done and kids use them for cereal.
Target User: Joy R | Keyword: love | Their Review: After having these bowls for over a year I had to get rid of them. They are a good size and cheap which is why I bought them but little annoyances killed my love for them. These bowls suction to eachother when you stack them. To the point where you sometimes have to pry them apart. Grease also clings to this stuff like crazy. Same for the plates of this material. I think the price is great and they are durable but needing to be washed twice and fighting just to get 1 bowl is so annoying.
Target User: targetallday | Keyword: love | Their Review: These are perfect for the stage we are in with our 1 year old and 3 year old. We use them for craft prep, recipe prep, breakfast, lunch, snacks, or dinner. It’s great for all of it and we love the color varieties, too!
Target User: Kelp30096 | Keyword: love | Their Review: I love this collection. I purchased a set of 20 bowls cups and plates a few years back and when my son moved out I split them with him. I recently moved again and my collection somehow got lost so I replaced them. I’m surprised that the price is still the same even in the store. Great product at a terrific price.
Target User: MamaCrosley | Keyword: Scratch | Their Review: You really can't beat the price and they last ages! They don't break, but they do scratch over time given the material.
Target User: PADME | Keyword: Can | Their Review: These bowls are a steal! They are deep and sturdy. They hold heat well and cool salads excellently! They clean well also; they can handle chilli and pasta dishes without staining! I want to buy more!
